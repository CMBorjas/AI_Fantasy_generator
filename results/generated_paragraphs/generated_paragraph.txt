In the mystical forest, under a harsh sun, a Monster moves silently among the ancient trees.

The Monster is a monster that is not afraid of the world. It is the only one who can protect the people of this world from the monsters.
The Monster has no fear of humans. He is afraid that the humans will not be able to protect him. This is why he is called the Monster of Death.
In the end, he will be the one to save the human race.
